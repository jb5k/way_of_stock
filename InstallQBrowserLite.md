## QBrowserLite

Many of us are using QBrowserLite to interact with OpenMQ instances.

## Download and Install

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbrowserv2/files/

Unpack the .zip to the location of your choice. Under linux many of us install tools into /opt

## Run

Cd into the install directory (classpaths won't resolve if you try to run from any other directory) and run ./run_open_mq.sh
