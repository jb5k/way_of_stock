# Installing KeePass

KeePass is an application/app that allows us to store all our Username/Password information.  Add to it if you find any usernames/passwords that are missing and update it when they change.  There is a folder under 'Personal' for each employee.  Totally up to you whether you wish to use this or not but it might be handy if anyone ever needs access to your machine for example.

## OSX
Get a mac friendly KeePass application from https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass

## Windows/Linux
Get a windows/linux fiendly application from http://keepass.info/download.html

## Android App
Up to you which one you chose but I've gone for Keepass2Android which works well.

## Apple App
Personal choice but MiniKeePass seems to get a good review.

## KeePass file
Can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BymDQK9P9Ps0UWswcm1KZFJ1WG8

## Password
Ask someone who knows :-)
