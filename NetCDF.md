## Using NetCDF files
We get these from the BOM, and provide them to Firemod and Rapidfire


## Panopoly
If you want to look at a NetCDF file then http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/ works well.

Open the file, you will see a number of variables: Lat/Long/time/some-thing-of-interest

Right-click on the something of interest, choose 'Create standard Plot'.

If you want to have it zoom to Victoria you can do this after the plot has opened, or by changing the default preferences:

In preferences, on the 'Lon-Lat Plots' tab, in the 'Map Plots' section:
 - Projection: Equirectangular (Regional)
 - Centre on 146, -36.5
 - Width: 15
 - Height: 6
