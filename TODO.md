  * Way of Stock Software:
    * Goals are to minimize development cost
    * Maintained over the next 15 years
    * Consistency
    * Variance starts as an experiment, is deliberate

  * Way of Development
    * Minimize dependencies
    * Consistent dependencies across all the applications
    * Make it like a single user wrote the code
    * Prefer making architecture identical even if it adds overhead
    * Duplicate it when used in two places, extract it when used in third
